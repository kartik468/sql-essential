1.	Compare DELETE and TRUNCATE
- Both are used for deleting records from table. With delete we can specify where clause. DELETE is DML command whereas TRUNCATE AND DROP ARE DDL commands. 
- So DELETE operation can be rolled back while DROP and TRUNCATE operations cannot be rolled back.
- In case of DELETE trigger get fired.
